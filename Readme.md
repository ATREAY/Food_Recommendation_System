# Food Recomendation System

## Abstract

Recommender systems are a type of machine learning algorithm that provides consumers with "relevant" recommendations. When we search for something anywhere, be it in an app or in our search engine, this recommender system is used to provide us with relevant results. They use a class of algorithms to find out the relevant recommendation for the user.
For example, if a user listens to rock music every day, his you tube recommendation feed will get full of rock music and music of related genres.
In this, items are ranked according to their relevancy and the most relevant ones are recommended to the user. 
The recommendation system must assess the relevance, which is primarily based on past data. Just like the rock music 
thing we just saw.
The recommender system is divided into mainly two categories: Collaborative filtering and content based filtering.

## Objectives

* The project entitled "Food Recommendation System based on Content Based Filtering Algorithm" recommends a food item list and displays the result depending on the nutritional value of the food item.
* If the food items that are in the database have either ingredient as a main ingredient, then the food items are listed in order of their nutritional value. 
* The project analyzes the food items in database and their main ingredients. When the ingredient that the user queried about is found, in the database of the food items present, they are sorted and filtered according to the nutritional value they contain. The amount of calorie that the food contains is taken into consideration here. 
* The suggestion to the user is based on the number of calories present in the food item. The recommendation is done based on Content Based Filtering Algorithm. 

* Keywords: Food Recommendation, Nutrition, Nutritional Value in Food, Content Based Filtering Algorithm.
